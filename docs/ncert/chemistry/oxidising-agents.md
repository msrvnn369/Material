# Oxidising agents (NCERT Chem Class 11 + 12) — quick table

This is a **revision table** of common **oxidising agents / oxidising reagents** used across NCERT Chemistry (inorganic + organic contexts).

> “Oxidising agent” here means: the reagent **gets reduced** and causes the other species to be **oxidised**.

## Table of oxidising reagents

| Oxidising reagent / oxidant | Typical “what it oxidises” (NCERT-level) | Common reduced form (what the oxidant becomes) | Notes / where it shows up |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Oxygen (O₂)** | Metals/non-metals → oxides; many combustions | O²⁻ (in oxides), H₂O (in combustion) | Very common oxidant; basis of oxidation in air |
| **Ozone (O₃)** | Strong oxidations; used for **ozonolysis** of alkenes (organic) | O₂ | Organic reactions + atmospheric chemistry context |
| **Halogens: Cl₂, Br₂ (and F₂)** | Oxidise I⁻ → I₂, Fe²⁺ → Fe³⁺, etc.; halogenation reactions (organic) | Cl⁻ / Br⁻ / F⁻ | Relative strength: F₂ > Cl₂ > Br₂ > I₂ (as oxidants) |
| **Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂)** | Oxidises many species (context-dependent) | H₂O | Can act as oxidant or reductant; NCERT highlights both behavior and conditions |
| **Acidified potassium permanganate (KMnO₄ / H⁺)** | Fe²⁺ → Fe³⁺, oxalate → CO₂, many organic oxidations (strong) | Mn²⁺ | Strong oxidant in acidic medium |
| **Alkaline/neutral KMnO₄** | Mild oxidations; e.g., unsaturation tests (Baeyer) | MnO₂ (brown ppt) / MnO₄²⁻ (depends) | Medium matters (acidic vs alkaline) |
| **Potassium dichromate (K₂Cr₂O₇ / H⁺)** | Alcohols/organic substrates; Fe²⁺ → Fe³⁺, etc. | Cr³⁺ | Classic “orange → green” redox indicator in acidic medium |
| **Chromic acid / CrO₃ in acid (often written as [O])** | Strong oxidation of organic functional groups (NCERT conversions) | Cr³⁺ | Often grouped with dichromate as “chromium(VI) oxidants” |
| **Concentrated nitric acid (HNO₃)** | Oxidises metals/non-metals; strong oxidations in p‑block chemistry | NO₂ / NO / other N-oxides | Acts as oxidising acid; products depend on conditions |
| **Concentrated sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄, hot)** | Oxidises e.g. I⁻/Br⁻ in reactions; dehydrating + oxidising in some cases | SO₂ (commonly) | “Oxidising acid” for some anions; also strong dehydrating agent |
| **Chlorine water / hypochlorous acid (HOCl)** | Oxidising + bleaching action | Cl⁻ | Used in bleaching/disinfection context |
| **Bleaching powder (CaOCl₂ / Ca(OCl)Cl)** | Oxidising + bleaching; converts dyes → colorless forms | Cl⁻ (overall) | Releases “available chlorine”; oxidant via OCl⁻/HOCl |
| **Hypochlorites (OCl⁻, e.g., NaOCl)** | Oxidation/bleaching; organic oxidations in some contexts | Cl⁻ | Same oxidising species family as bleaching powder |
| **Chlorate (KClO₃)** | Oxidises on heating / in lab prep contexts | Cl⁻ | Often appears in oxygen preparation/oxidation reactions |
| **Permanganate/dichromate “in redox titrations”** | Standard oxidants in volumetric analysis | Mn²⁺ / Cr³⁺ | Included because NCERT uses them heavily in redox chapter problems |
| **Manganese dioxide (MnO₂)** | Oxidises Cl⁻ (from HCl) to Cl₂ (lab prep) / other oxidations | Mn²⁺ (in acid) | Standard lab oxidant in inorganic preparations |
| **Lead dioxide (PbO₂)** | Oxidant in some inorganic preparations | Pb²⁺ | Less common but appears as a strong oxidant in inorganic chemistry contexts |
| **Ferric ion (Fe³⁺)** | Oxidises I⁻ → I₂; Fe³⁺ ↔ Fe²⁺ redox | Fe²⁺ | Mild oxidant; shows in redox and electrochemistry |
| **Cupric ion (Cu²⁺)** | Oxidises more reactive metals; involved in displacement/redox | Cu⁺ / Cu | Common in redox/displacement examples |
| **Silver ion (Ag⁺)** | Oxidises Cu → Cu²⁺ etc. (cell reactions) | Ag(s) | Standard electrochemical cell examples (Ag⁺/Ag has high E°) |
| **Acidified iodate / bromate (e.g., IO₃⁻, BrO₃⁻)** | Oxidise I⁻ → I₂ (iodometry contexts) | I⁻ / Br⁻ (overall reduced products) | Appears in some redox/analytical-style examples; keep if used in your class notes |
| **Peroxydisulfate (S₂O₈²⁻)** | Strong oxidant in aqueous redox examples | SO₄²⁻ | Often mentioned as a strong oxidant (electrochem/redox context) |

## Quick “strong oxidants” list (exam-style)

- **KMnO₄ (acidic)**, **K₂Cr₂O₇ (acidic)**, **O₃**, **HNO₃ (conc)**, **halogens (esp. F₂/Cl₂)**, **S₂O₈²⁻**

## If you want this to be 100% NCERT-chapter-mapped

Tell me whether you want the table split into:
- **Class 11** (Redox + s/p block basics) vs **Class 12** (Electrochem + d/f block + organic chapters), and
- **inorganic oxidants** vs **organic oxidation reagents**

Then I’ll reorganize it and add “chapter” columns (without reproducing textbook text).
