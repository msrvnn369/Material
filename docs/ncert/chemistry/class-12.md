# NCERT Chemistry — Class 12 (Textbooks)

This section is for **chapter-wise navigation + quick study notes** aligned to the NCERT Chemistry textbooks.

> Note: NCERT textbooks are copyrighted. This site should **not** host full verbatim textbook text.
> We can keep **summaries, key definitions, solved examples we create**, and **links to the official NCERT PDFs**.

## Official NCERT source

- NCERT textbook PDFs (official): `https://ncert.nic.in/textbook.php`

## Chapters (Class 12)

Use this as a checklist. I can expand each chapter into a separate page with:
- key terms + 5–15 line concept summaries
- common pitfalls + “why” explanations
- a few original practice questions + solutions

## Quick revision tables

- [Oxidising agents (table)](oxidising-agents.md)
