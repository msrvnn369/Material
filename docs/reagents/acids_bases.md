# Acids & bases (common workhorses)

This is a “what do we typically use it for?” list (not a p\(K_a\) table).

## Acids

| Acid | Typical role in NCERT reactions | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Dil. \(\mathrm{HCl}\)** | Salt formation; hydrolysis workups; diazotization medium | Strong acid, aqueous. |
| **Conc. \(\mathrm{H_2SO_4}\)** | Dehydration; nitration mixture component; catalyst | Also a strong dehydrating agent. |
| **Conc. \(\mathrm{HNO_3}\)** | Nitration (with \(\mathrm{H_2SO_4}\)) | Generates \(\mathrm{NO_2^+}\) with \(\mathrm{H_2SO_4}\). |
| **\(\mathrm{H_3PO_4}\)** | Alternative acid catalyst / dehydrating medium | Milder/less oxidizing than \(\mathrm{H_2SO_4}\). |
| **\(\mathrm{CH_3COOH}\)** | Solvent/acid medium; esterification component | Weak acid; often used as solvent + proton source. |

## Bases

| Base | Typical role in NCERT reactions | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **\(\mathrm{NaOH/KOH}\)** | Phenoxide formation; aldol/Cannizzaro; elimination; hydrolysis | “Aq.” vs “alc.” changes outcome (substitution vs elimination). |
| **Alcoholic \(\mathrm{KOH}\)** | Dehydrohalogenation (E2) | Promotes elimination due to basicity + lower solvation. |
| **\(\mathrm{NH_3}\) (alc.)** | Ammonolysis (alkyl halide → amine) | Gives mixture (1°,2°,3° amines) unless controlled. |
| **Pyridine** | Base/scavenger with acylation or \(\mathrm{SOCl_2}\) | Not a “strong base” like \(\mathrm{NaOH}\); often used to trap \(\mathrm{HCl}\). |

## One-line memory hooks

- “**Acidified** oxidations” (e.g., dichromate) mean acid is part of the reagent system, not just workup.
- “**Alcoholic KOH**” is the usual keyword for **elimination**.
