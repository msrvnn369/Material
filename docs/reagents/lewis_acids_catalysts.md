# Lewis acids & catalysts (activation / electrophile generation)

These reagents are typically used to **generate stronger electrophiles** or **activate functional groups**.

## Friedel–Crafts / aromatic EAS activators

| Reagent | Typical role | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **\(\mathrm{AlCl_3}\)** | Lewis acid to generate \(\mathrm{R^+}\) / acylium-like electrophiles | Key in Friedel–Crafts alkylation/acylation. |
| \(\mathrm{FeCl_3}\), \(\mathrm{FeBr_3}\) | Halogen EAS catalysts | Polarize \(\mathrm{Cl_2/Br_2}\) to generate electrophile. |

## Hydrogenation catalysts

| Catalyst | Typical role | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Ni / Pt / Pd** | Catalytic hydrogenation with \(\mathrm{H_2}\) | Used for alkenes; also for some nitro reductions. |

## Hydration/dehydration acid catalysts (conceptual bucket)

- Mineral acids (often \(\mathrm{H_2SO_4}\), \(\mathrm{H_3PO_4}\)) act as **catalysts** in multiple addition/elimination processes by protonation (electrophile activation).
