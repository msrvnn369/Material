# Common solvents (what they’re used for)

In many exam solutions, the solvent is a **clue** for mechanism and reagent compatibility.

## Polar protic vs polar aprotic (fast recall)

- **Polar protic** (ROH, \(\mathrm{H_2O}\)): strong H-bonding; solvates anions strongly → often slows SN2, can favor ionization.
- **Polar aprotic** (DMSO, DMF, MeCN, acetone): weak anion solvation → often speeds up SN2.

## Frequent “named” solvents in NCERT-style problems

| Solvent | Why it shows up | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Ethanol** | “Alcoholic” conditions; solvates bases/nucleophiles | Alcoholic KOH is a standard phrase. |
| **Water** | Hydrolysis, diazotization medium, workups | Often changes equilibrium and drives salt formation. |
| **Ether (dry)** | \(\mathrm{LiAlH_4}\) reactions | “Dry ether” is a compatibility requirement. |
| **\(\mathrm{CH_2Cl_2}\)** | PCC oxidations | Common non-protic solvent for mild oxidations. |
| **Acetic acid** | Acidic solvent medium | Can be both solvent and reagent environment. |
