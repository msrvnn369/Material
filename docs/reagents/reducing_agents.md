# Reducing agents (common NCERT patterns)

Reduction is often “**increase in C–H / decrease in C–O (or C–X)**” (or decrease in oxidation state).

## High-yield mapping (what to use for what)

| Substrate → product | Typical reductant(s) | Notes / common caveats |
|---|---|---|
| Aldehyde → 1° alcohol | **\(\mathrm{NaBH_4}\)** / **\(\mathrm{LiAlH_4}\)** / \(\mathrm{H_2/Ni}\) | \(\mathrm{NaBH_4}\) is milder and more selective. |
| Ketone → 2° alcohol | \(\mathrm{NaBH_4}\) / \(\mathrm{LiAlH_4}\) / \(\mathrm{H_2/Ni}\) | Standard carbonyl reduction. |
| Carboxylic acid / ester → 1° alcohol | **\(\mathrm{LiAlH_4}\)** (ether), then workup | \(\mathrm{NaBH_4}\) usually does **not** reduce acids/esters. |
| Nitrobenzene / nitro compounds → amines | **\(\mathrm{Sn/HCl}\)** or **\(\mathrm{Fe/HCl}\)** or \(\mathrm{H_2/Ni}\) | Acidic metal reduction is a frequent NCERT route. |
| Alkene → alkane | \(\mathrm{H_2/Ni}\) / \(\mathrm{H_2/Pt}\) / \(\mathrm{H_2/Pd}\) | Catalytic hydrogenation. |
| Alkyl halide → alkane | “Nascent” \(\mathrm{H}\) sources (e.g., \(\mathrm{Zn/HCl}\)) | Not always emphasized; conditions matter. |

## Reductions in diazonium chemistry (very common)

- \(\mathrm{ArN_2^+Cl^- \xrightarrow{H_3PO_2} Ar{-}H}\) (replacement by hydrogen; “deamination”).

## Quick selectivity reminders

- **\(\mathrm{NaBH_4}\)**: aldehydes/ketones (mild).
- **\(\mathrm{LiAlH_4}\)**: stronger; reduces many carboxylic derivatives (needs dry ether; violent with water).
