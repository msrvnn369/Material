# Reagents (NCERT-oriented index)

This section is a **reagent cheat-sheet**: what a reagent typically does, what it does *not* do, and the most common “exam-usable” pairings.

## Categories

- [Oxidising agents](oxidising_agents.md)
- [Reducing agents](reducing_agents.md)
- [Halogenating / chlorinating / brominating agents](halogenating_agents.md)
- [Dehydrating & drying agents](dehydrating_drying_agents.md)
- [Acids & bases (common workhorses)](acids_bases.md)
- [Lewis acids & catalysts (activation / electrophile generation)](lewis_acids_catalysts.md)
- [Common solvents (what they’re used for)](solvents.md)

## Conventions used here

- “Acidified” typically means \(\mathrm{H_2SO_4}\) unless stated otherwise.
- Where conditions matter, they’re written explicitly (e.g., “hot alkaline”, “cold dilute”, “anhydrous”, “peroxide free”).
