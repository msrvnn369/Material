# Dehydrating & drying agents

These are often confused in revision, so this page splits them:

- **Dehydrating agents**: remove water *from a molecule / reaction mixture* by driving elimination or water capture.
- **Drying agents**: remove *trace water* from organic solvents/products.

## Dehydrating agents (reaction-driving)

| Use-case | Reagent(s) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Alcohol → alkene (dehydration) | **Conc. \(\mathrm{H_2SO_4}\)**, heat | E1/E2 depending on substrate; rearrangements possible for 2°/3°. |
| Alcohol → ether (at lower \(T\), some cases) | Conc. \(\mathrm{H_2SO_4}\) | Temperature control matters. |
| “Strong water scavenger” | **\(\mathrm{P_2O_5}\)** | Very powerful dehydrator (phosphorus pentoxide). |
| Aldol condensation (water removal step) | Heat / acid/base as specified | Not a single reagent, but dehydration step is key. |

## Drying agents (workup / solvent drying)

| Drying agent | Often used for | Common caveat |
|---|---|---|
| **Anhydrous \(\mathrm{CaCl_2}\)** | Many alcohol-free organic layers | Avoid with alcohols/amines (complexation). |
| **Anhydrous \(\mathrm{Na_2SO_4}\)** | General-purpose, mild | Slower than \(\mathrm{MgSO_4}\) in many cases. |
| **Anhydrous \(\mathrm{MgSO_4}\)** | General-purpose, fast | Can be very fine; filtration considerations. |
| **Quicklime \(\mathrm{CaO}\)** | Drying certain gases/solvents | Specific use-cases; not universal. |
