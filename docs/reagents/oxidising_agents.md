# Oxidising agents (common NCERT patterns)

Oxidation in organic chemistry is often “**increase in C–O / decrease in C–H**” (or increase in oxidation state).

## High-yield mapping (what to use for what)

| Substrate → product | Typical oxidant(s) | Notes / common caveats |
|---|---|---|
| 1° alcohol → aldehyde | **PCC** (in \(\mathrm{CH_2Cl_2}\)) | Mild; avoids over-oxidation to acid (no aqueous conditions). |
| 1° alcohol → carboxylic acid | **Acidified \(\mathrm{K_2Cr_2O_7}\)** / **acidified \(\mathrm{KMnO_4}\)** | Strong; aqueous/acidic conditions push to acid. |
| 2° alcohol → ketone | Acidified \(\mathrm{K_2Cr_2O_7}\) or \(\mathrm{KMnO_4}\); PCC | Usually clean to ketone. |
| Aldehyde → carboxylic acid | \(\mathrm{Tollens}\), \(\mathrm{Fehling}\), \(\mathrm{KMnO_4}\), \(\mathrm{K_2Cr_2O_7}\) | Aldehydes oxidize readily vs ketones. |
| Alkene → vicinal diol | **Cold dilute alkaline \(\mathrm{KMnO_4}\)** (Baeyer) | Syn-dihydroxylation; “cold, dilute” is the memory hook. |
| Alkene → oxidative cleavage | **Hot conc. \(\mathrm{KMnO_4}\)** / ozonolysis | Cleavage pattern depends on substitution. |
| Alkylbenzene side chain → benzoic acid | **Hot alkaline \(\mathrm{KMnO_4}\)**, then acid workup | Needs at least one benzylic H. |

## Named / diagnostic oxidations (frequent in NCERT)

- **Acidified \(\mathrm{K_2Cr_2O_7}\) / \(\mathrm{CrO_3}\)**: classical strong oxidation of alcohols (orange → green test association).
- **Acidified \(\mathrm{KMnO_4}\)**: very strong; decolourisation (purple → colourless/brown).
- **PCC (pyridinium chlorochromate)**: “stop at aldehyde” for 1° alcohols (anhydrous).

## Quick “what usually does NOT oxidize”

- **Most simple ketones**: resist mild oxidants (need harsh cleavage-type conditions).
- **Aryl/vinyl C–H**: not oxidized by typical aqueous \(\mathrm{KMnO_4}\) unless strong/benzylic/activated context.
