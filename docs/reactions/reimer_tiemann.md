# Reimer–Tiemann reaction: mechanism

## Transformation

Base-mediated formylation of phenols using chloroform.

Conditions: \(\mathrm{CHCl_3}\), \(\mathrm{NaOH}\) or \(\mathrm{KOH}\), heat; acidic workup.

## Key intermediate: dichlorocarbene

Base deprotonates chloroform:

\[
\mathrm{CHCl_3 + OH^- \rightleftharpoons CCl_3^- + H_2O}
\]

Then \(\mathrm{CCl_3^-}\) undergoes \(\alpha\)-elimination to give **dichlorocarbene**:

\[
\mathrm{CCl_3^- \rightarrow :CCl_2 + Cl^-}
\]

## Ring activation (phenoxide formation)

Under basic conditions, phenol becomes **phenoxide**, which is:

- **More nucleophilic** than phenol.
- Directing strongly **ortho/para** (via resonance donation into the ring).

## C–C bond formation and hydrolysis

1. Electrophilic capture of :CCl₂ by the activated ring (ortho/para) → \(\sigma\)-complex.
2. Rearomatization → aryl–CCl₂ intermediate.
3. Base-promoted hydrolysis converts –CCl₂ to –CHO; workup affords the aldehyde.

Formyl carbon source: \(\mathrm{CHCl_3}\).

## Regioselectivity

In many phenols:

- Ortho is favored because the **phenoxide oxygen can coordinate / chelate** in the transition state and because intramolecular H-bonding can stabilize products like salicylaldehyde.
- Sterics can push para if ortho is blocked.
