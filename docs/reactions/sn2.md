# SN2: major patterns and exceptions

## Definition

SN2 is a concerted nucleophilic substitution:

\[
\mathrm{Nu^- + R{-}LG \rightarrow R{-}Nu + LG^-}
\]

- **Kinetics**: \( \text{rate} = k[\mathrm{Nu^-}][\mathrm{R{-}LG}] \)
- **Stereochemistry**: backside attack → inversion at a stereogenic center.

## Substrate effects

Reactivity trend (steric control): **methyl > 1° > 2° \(\gg\) 3°**.

- 3° substrates: SN2 is kinetically inhibited; E2 dominates with strong base.
- Neopentyl (formally 1°): strongly inhibited by sterics.
- Benzylic/allylic: often fast (stabilized transition state; accessible geometry).

## Leaving group effects

Leaving group ability generally follows conjugate base weakness:

- **Best**: \(\mathrm{I^- > Br^- > Cl^- \gg F^-}\)
- **Sulfonates**: OTs, OMs, OTf are excellent.

Bad leaving groups (unless activated): \(\mathrm{HO^-}\), \(\mathrm{RO^-}\), \(\mathrm{NH_2^-}\).

## Nucleophile and solvent effects

Determinants: nucleophilicity and sterics.

- bulky nucleophiles suppress SN2 and bias E2 (e.g., \(t\)-BuO⁻).
- anions are typically more nucleophilic than neutral analogs.

Solvent effects:

- polar aprotic (DMSO, DMF, MeCN, acetone): accelerate SN2 by weak anion solvation.
- polar protic (ROH, H₂O): suppress SN2 by strong anion solvation.

Halide nucleophilicity in protic solvent: \( \mathrm{I^- > Br^- > Cl^- > F^-} \).

## Exceptions (frequent exam cases)

- 3° alkyl halides: not SN2 (sterics); E2/SN1 pathways dominate depending on base/solvent.
- aryl/vinyl halides: not SN2 at C(sp²)–X.
- SN2/E2 competition at 2°: strengthened by bulky base and higher temperature.

## Decision table

- **Methyl / 1° substrate + polar aprotic + decent nucleophile** → SN2 very likely.
- **2° substrate + strong base/nucleophile** → SN2/E2 competition; sterics + temperature decide.
- **3° substrate + strong base** → E2.
- **Aryl/vinyl substrate** → not SN2.
